Johanna Hansen is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science advised by Gregory Dudek at McGill University.  Her research is focused on learning models of the physical world for use with interactive agents. As a part-time intern at SAIC-Montreal, she develops learning agents with dexterous manipulation policies. Johanna received B.S. degrees at Texas State University in Electrical Engineering and Environmental Resource Geography with full funding through the Terry Foundation. In addition to interning at SAIC Montreal, Johanna spent a summer interning at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) working on machine vision aspects of the Mars Sample Return Mission. Prior to graduate school, Johanna was an at-sea engineer for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Sentry, in the National Deep Submergence Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and an engineer working on applied sensing at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).
